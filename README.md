# Simulation-Of-An-Banking-System
The objective of this project is to simulate the aspect of a database used by a general bank, using SQL Oracle as its programming language.
The project provides you with 10 tables filled with relevant columns for this domain and every table has at least 10 rows. 

* More detalis about the tables and their features can be found in the txt file of this repositorie.

** This project has a didactic character, made for the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics and Economic Informatics, ASE, Bucharest. Also, the naming of the tables, columns and other information is made in Romanian, so translating them might be necessary for speakers of other foreign languages to be able to understand the topic.
